1)what is java explain with a flow diagram

>Java is a object oriented programming language,
it was developed by James gosling and it is owned by oracle company

Java consists of JDK,JRE and JVM
    JDK
		>It stands for java Development kit
		>It consists of javac 
		>It provides kit to develop java applications,
		there are many different versions in taht jdk 1.8 is stable version
	   
    
	JRE
		>It stands for Java run time environment
		>It consists of libraries and JVM

	JVM
		>JVM stands for Java virtual machine
		>It is not present in reality
		>JVM search for main method signature to start excution of java program

2)what is wora ,platform indepent and .class flow diaggram

>Wora is write once run anywhere,because we can execute .class file in any operating system 
>byte code(.class) has the ability to run in any operating system because of that java
is platform independent

3)Types of datatypes

>There are 2 types
1)primitive datatype           2)Non primitive datatype
byte                             String
short                            Array
int                              Custom classes
long
char
boolean
float
double

4)explain methods and constructors with example
>methods takes set of arguments perform some operation to get desired outcome
>methods consists of 2 types
>Static and instance method
>static method are the methods which doesn't accept instance variables

Ex:public static void methodName(){
	
}
>Instance methods are the ones which we have to create instance of that class in order acess that,
it accept both static and instance variables
Ex:
public void method(){
	
}
 
>Constructor is a special type of method which doesn't return any value
Constructor is classified as default , noargument ,parameterized constructor
Ex:
class Bonda{
	
	public int noOfBonda;
	
	public Bonda(int total){
		this.noOfBonda=total;
		System.out.println("total==="+noOfBonda);
	}
	
}

class BondaRunner{
	
	public static void main(String []args){
		Bonda bonda=new Bonda(10);
	}
}


5)explain polymorysim by using costructor

>Polymorphysim is one of object oriented principle
>It defined as same name with different forms
>It consists 2 types:
>Overloading and overriding

Method or constructor overloading means having same method name or constructor 
but with different parameters 

Ex:
class Bonda{
	
	public Bonda(int total){
		System.out.println("total==="+total);
	}
	
	public Bonda(int total,String ownerName){
		System.out.println("total=="+total+"owner name==="+ownerName);
	}
}

class BondaRunner{
	
	public static void main(String []args){
		Bonda bonda=new Bonda(10);
		Bonda bajji=new Bonda(100,"Ravi");
	}
}

6)explain switch cases with example

>class Week{
	
	public static void main(String []args){
		
		int noOfTheDay=5;
		String dayName="Friday";
		
		switch(noOfTheDay){
		
		 case 1:dayName="Monday";
		 break;
		 
		 case 2:dayName="Tuesday";
		 break;
		 
		 case 3:dayName="Wednesday";
		 break;
		 
		 case 4:dayName="Thursday";
		 break;
		 
		 case 5:dayName="Friday";
		 break;
		 
		 case 6:dayName="Saturday";
		 break;
		 
		 case 7:dayName="Sunday";
		 break;
		 
		 default:dayName="Invalid";
		 break;
		}
		System.out.println("the name of the particular day is=="+dayName);
	}
}



7)explain 10 keywords

>class is a keyword which acts as the statring point of the java program and the declaration of class is
class ObjectName{}

>public is an access specifier which allows to access variables and methods inside and outside the class
>if else is a condition to get desired outcome
>default gives default value when no other value matches or present
>this refers to current object of the classand it mainly used to remove confussion between
 class attributes and attributes in methods
>new is a keyword used create instance of the class
>for loop
>Switch
>return --which return a value
>break-- stop the execution of remaining part when it is called
>static is keyword which is used declare global variable and static method



8)expalin this chaining

this refers to current object of the classand it mainly used to remove confussion between
 class attributes and attributes in methods

class Bonda{
	
	public int noOfBonda;
	public String name

	public Bonda(int total){
		this.noOfBonda=total;
		System.out.println("total==="+total);
	}
	
	public Bonda(int total,String ownerName){
		this.noOfBonda=total;
		this.name=ownerName
		System.out.println("total=="+total+"owner name==="+ownerName);
	}
}

class BondaRunner{
	
	public static void main(String []args){
		Bonda bonda=new Bonda(10);
		Bonda bajji=new Bonda(100,"Ravi");
	}
}
