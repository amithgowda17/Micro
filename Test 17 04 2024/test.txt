1) what is java
  
  java is a object oriented programming language and it is platform independent

2) Explain the architecure of java with flow diagram

   java contains jdk(java development kit) tool kit where it contains JRE(java runtime environment),
   it is used to compile source code to byte code and it also contains libraries  and jvm(java virtual machine) 
   where it is used to execute byte code by seraching main method in any operating system because of
   jvm so that's why java is known as platform independent

3) define class
   
   class is a keyword and it is a blueprint that object follows and it can be declared as
class ObjectName{}

4) explain datatypes and types of datatypes and flow types
   
   datatype refers to the type of value where the variable store in the memory
datatypes are divide into two types
* primitive datatype
* Non-primitive datatype

5) define variable with syntax
  variable is a reference name given to memory location
  the syntax to declare a variable is==
         datatype referenceName;
  initialization of variable is===
       datatype referenceName=value;

8)explain about platform independent and wora

   java is known as platform independent because jvm(java virtual machine) has 
   the ability to run the byte code in any operating systems like windows,mac,linux etc
